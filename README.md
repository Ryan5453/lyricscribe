## Introduction

music2text is a research project that I'm currently working on to measure the effect of background noise on audio transcription. 

## Base Model
This project and its respective benchmarks are based off OpenAI's Whisper [large-v3-turbo](https://github.com/openai/whisper/pull/2361/files) model.
